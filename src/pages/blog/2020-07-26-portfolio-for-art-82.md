Exposure assignment - I chose this image because her mask represents our current times.

Panning was the most challenging shot this semester, but we had fun!

Peekaboo! I see you!

Low light - This was my favorite of the 4th of July images.

![Contact sheet](/img/i9.jpg "Contact sheet")

It was nice to learn about contact sheets, I think they can be very useful for picking poses to edit.

![Contact sheet](/img/j10.jpg "Contact sheet")

There is no better way to do contact sheets than with beautiful faces!

![Golden Gate Bridge](/img/k11.jpg "Golden Gate Bridge")

Color correction - You can see the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, Alcatraz, and the bay.

![Transamerica building](/img/l12.jpg "Transamerica building")

Black & White - I wanted to show the contrast between old and modern architecture together.

![Bay Bridge](/img/m13.jpg "Bay Bridge")

This was my favorite from the black and white assignment, the contrast came out very well.

![Black and White buildings](/img/n14.jpg "Black and White buildings")

This photo shows the light coming through the buildings and the texture of each responding to the light.

The Embarcadero fountain and the Ferry clock tower.

Sending good vibes all of the way. This was my last photoshoot of the semester. I have learned so much and have really enjoyed the assignments each week, thank you!
